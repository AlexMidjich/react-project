<h1>React Project</h1>

<p>This is a project I am making in React, the projekt is for my course in advanced webapplications part 2</p>
<p>With this project I am learning to set up a React working space using npm-react-build. My app is then built with the React.js structure using:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Props & State</li>
 <li>Stateless components</li>
 <li>Redux for method and event handeling</li>
 <li>Firebase as a database</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Database storing</li>
   <li>Log in with username and password and a social log in </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>In order to test the app you can download it here from the repository. Run npm install to get node_modules. Then install the dependencies for react, redux and firebase.</p>

<h3>The app</h3>
<p>The application I have created is something I call "Bokcirkeln". Basicly when you log in you will be able to get sugestions on books you can read and to leave a review or comment on the book. All the comments will be stored to your username. You will also be able to delete your own comments.</p>
